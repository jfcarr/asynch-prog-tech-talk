To collect the results of multiple asynchronous calls in Java, you can use `CompletableFuture.allOf()` or `CompletableFuture.anyOf()`. The `allOf()` method is particularly useful when you want to wait for all the asynchronous tasks to complete and then collect their results.

Hereâ€™s an example that demonstrates how to make multiple asynchronous calls and collect their results:

### Example: Collecting Results from Multiple Asynchronous Calls

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class AsyncMultipleCallsExample {

    // Asynchronous function that simulates a long-running task
    public static CompletableFuture<String> fetchDataAsync(int id) {
        return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            try {
                // Simulate a delay (e.g., fetching data from a database or an API)
                Thread.sleep(2000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            return "Data fetched for ID: " + id;
        });
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Calling multiple asynchronous functions...");

        // Create a list to hold the CompletableFutures
        List<CompletableFuture<String>> futures = new ArrayList<>();

        // Initiate multiple asynchronous calls
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            futures.add(fetchDataAsync(i));
        }

        // Combine all futures into a single CompletableFuture
        CompletableFuture<Void> allOf = CompletableFuture.allOf(futures.toArray(new CompletableFuture[0]));

        // Wait for all futures to complete
        allOf.join();

        // Collect results from all futures
        List<String> results = new ArrayList<>();
        for (CompletableFuture<String> future : futures) {
            results.add(future.join()); // Get the result of each future
        }

        // Print the collected results
        System.out.println("Collected Results:");
        results.forEach(System.out::println);
        System.out.println("Main method completed.");
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Asynchronous Function**: The `fetchDataAsync(int id)` method simulates a long-running task and returns a `CompletableFuture<String>` with a message that includes the ID.

2. **Main Method**:
   - It prints a message indicating that multiple asynchronous functions are being called.
   - It creates a list of `CompletableFuture<String>` to hold the futures returned by the asynchronous calls.
   - It initiates multiple asynchronous calls in a loop, adding each future to the list.
   - It uses `CompletableFuture.allOf()` to create a combined future that completes when all the individual futures complete.
   - It calls `allOf.join()` to wait for all the asynchronous tasks to finish.
   - It then collects the results from each future using `future.join()` and stores them in a list.
   - Finally, it prints the collected results.

### Output:

When you run this program, you will see output similar to the following:

```
Calling multiple asynchronous functions...
Collected Results:
Data fetched for ID: 1
Data fetched for ID: 2
Data fetched for ID: 3
Data fetched for ID: 4
Data fetched for ID: 5
Main method completed.
```

This demonstrates how to make multiple asynchronous calls, wait for all of them to complete, and collect their results in Java using `CompletableFuture`.
