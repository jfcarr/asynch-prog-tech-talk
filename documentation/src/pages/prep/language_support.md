You can skip the Language Support section if you just want to view the code. Assumes you're using Linux.

## Python

The Python 3 interpreter is probably already installed.  If not, you should be able to find it in your package manager.

## JavaScript

No special setup needed: You can view the .HTML source in any editor, and any installed browser can load it.

## Rust

Instructions here: <https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started>

## Go

## C and C++

If the C and C++ compilers aren't already installed, you can find them in your package manager.

I'm using the GNU C (gcc) and C++ (g++) compilers.  You should be able to use Clang if you prefer, but you'll need to tweak the Makefile in the source directories.

## .NET / C#

I'm using .NET 8.

If Java isn't already installed, you can either install it from your package manager, or from here: <https://openjdk.org/>
