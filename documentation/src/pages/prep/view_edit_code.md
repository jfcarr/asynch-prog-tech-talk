# Viewing and Editing Code

You should be able to use any editor or IDE you prefer, but I highly recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): You can install extensions specific to each language so that you can stay in the same editor.

(I will probably be using [Zed](https://zed.dev/download) for Ruby though: I've had some trouble getting the Ruby language server to work in VS Code.)
