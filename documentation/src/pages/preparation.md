# Preparation

## Language Support

You can skip the Language Support section if you just want to view the code. Assumes you're using Linux.

### Python

The Python 3 interpreter is probably already installed.  If not, you should be able to find it in your package manager.

### JavaScript

No special setup needed: You can view the .HTML source in any editor, and any installed browser can load it.

### Rust

Instructions here: <https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started>

### Go

Instructions here: <https://go.dev/learn/>

### C++

If the C++ compiler isn't already installed, you can find it in your package manager.

I'm using the GNU C++ compiler (g++).  You should be able to use Clang if you prefer, but you'll need to tweak the Makefile in the source directory.

### .NET / C#

Instructions here: <https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download>

I'm using .NET 8.

### Java

If Java isn't already installed, you can either install it from your package manager, or from here: <https://openjdk.org/>

### Ruby

Ruby can be installed from your package manager.

## Viewing and Editing Code

You should be able to use any editor or IDE you prefer, but I highly recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): You can install extensions specific to each language so that you can stay in the same editor.

(I will probably be using [Zed](https://zed.dev/download) for Ruby though: I've had some trouble getting the Ruby language server to work in VS Code.)
