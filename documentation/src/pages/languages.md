# Languages

I selected nine popular programming languages, all(-ish) of which have strong support for asynchronous programming.

## How Did I Choose?

* [TIOBE Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)
* [PYPL PopularitY of Programming Language Index](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html)
* [Language Comparison](https://openhub.net/languages/compare) on Black Duck Open Hub
* [Stack Overflow 2024 Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology)

I also tweaked the presentation order based on a language popularity poll on Discord.
